## Installation 
First you must have node and npm installed on your machine. Next, clode my github repository onto your local machine. Once cloned, navigate to the 'index.js' file in your command line and run the command *npm install*. This will install all dependencies.

## Usage 
Once you have the neccesary dependencies installed, within your command line (still within the correct file location) run the command *node index.js*. From there follow the prompts within your command line.

At the end of the prompts a READMEnew.md file will be generated.
